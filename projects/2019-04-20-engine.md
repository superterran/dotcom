Engine implements a multi-tennant web server so you can develop against and access all the sites at once. To accomplish this with a mix of sites across multiple platforms, it maintains multiple php-fpm instances running different versions. So a Magento 1 sites can run in the older php 5.6 while newer sites can run in php 7.1. This makes things a bit easier compared to solutions like valet.

Engine is designed to work like a bare- metal solution, but it's really a docker composition with some tooling built around it. Docker allows this to easily target multiple dev environments, not to mention making it easy to support a broad range of site types.
