title: 'Star Trek Discovery, a bitter analysis'
---

One thing I've learned this year is that I'm a toxic Star Trek fan. According to Shit Posters, both the Facebook group and reddit commentor variety, I endlessly critique bothersome details and in doing so miss out on all the wonder and spectacle. Perhaps my adulation of TNG era Trek, knowing all the tapes and my reverence to all mighty Canon has posioned me? Am I incapable of enjoying new Trek?

The last week, the lady and I have been watching the Star Trek movie collection. Star Trek II is glorious, the scenes with Ricardo_Montalb√°n, his revenge orgasims are the stuff of legend.

But how did I feel about Into Darkness? Predictably, I hated the casting of Kahn. Some british white guy? What were they thinking?! I recall predicting before the movie that Kahn was going to be part of Section 31 somehow. Fast forward a few years, Section 31 is mainstream. The discovery has a Section 31 officer, is being chased around by Section 31 ships, hell the whole Federation is taking orders from a Section 31 AI. 

Star Trek IV, the Whale one, is probably my favorite overall. It's also the worst offender, in terms of groan moments.
