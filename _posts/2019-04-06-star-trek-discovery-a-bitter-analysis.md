title: 'Star Trek Discovery, a bitter analysis'
---

One thing I've learned this year is that I'm a toxic Star Trek fan. According to Shit Posters, both the Facebook group and reddit commentor variety, I endlessly critique bothersome details and in doing so miss out on all the wonder and spectacle. Perhaps my adulation of TNG era Trek, knowing all the tapes and my reverence to all mighty Canon has posioned me? Am I incapable of enjoying new Trek?
