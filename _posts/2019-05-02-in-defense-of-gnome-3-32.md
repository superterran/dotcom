It's fair to say gnome-shell is, and always has been, polarizing. There's folks like me who love it and think it's picked up Apple's mantle of driving the workstation desktop. There are others who see it as a spartan waste of good screen realestate. These two perspectives are at odds, and the GNOME community has gained a reputation for dismissing the latter and shoving the former down everyones throats. If you spend a few minutes appreciating the GNOME design philosophy or flipping through their [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/), they are on on the right track here.  

I came across [this critique of GNOME](https://jatan.tech/2019/05/01/gnome-3-32-is-awesome-but-still-has-key-areas-for-improvements/) the other day on Reddit. What's been interesting is that the GNOME reddit community has been very supportive of the article, even prompting discussion within the GNOME team about interface changes. When I read the article, I thought he was far off the mark. 

They might not have had threaded multi-tasking in Windows 95, but the the GUI concepts it introduced still hang around today. The icon-covered desktop is a good example. My father, from the moment he installed Windows 95, til this day running Mojave, has more desktop icons than desktop realestate. 


So the Fedora 30 release this week brings with it GNOME 3.32, which comes with some nice incremental updates and a light visual refresh. I enthusastically upgraded to it as fast as I could, and have so far been pleasantly surprised by the incremental improvements. It's faster, more stable, and Fedora's seamless boot experience really completes the package.
