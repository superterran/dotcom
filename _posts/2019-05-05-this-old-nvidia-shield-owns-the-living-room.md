The Shield isn't a new device, the TV set-top box version has been out since 2017, which makes this thing comparatively anchient beside my other devices. Interestingly, in the Hatcher livingroom it's coupled with a Nintendo Switch, which is another nVidia Tegra X device.  Between the two, and any other device i've used in the living room, the Shield ranks as my favorite and is so versitile that I couldn't imagine my living room without it. With the rumor mill suggesting that a hardwarer refresh is coming this year, I thought it would be nice to touch on what makes the device so great, and then maybe we'll compare notes when the new one comes out.

Let's start with the Controller.
